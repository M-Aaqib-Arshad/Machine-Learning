    "> What Is the Least Squares Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The least squares method is a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the line of best fit for a set of data, providing a visual demonstration of the relationship between the data points. Each point of data represents the relationship between a known independent variable and an unknown dependent variable. This method is commonly used by statisticians and traders who want to identify trading opportunities and trends."
